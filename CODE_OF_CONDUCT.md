# Neeva Developer Code of Conduct

The Neeva Developer team is committed to preserving and fostering a welcoming,
inclusive and diverse community.

This community code of conduct applies to our repos and organizations, issue
trackers, mailing lists, discord channels, blog content, and any other Neeva
Developer-supported communication group, as well as any private communication
initiated in the context of these spaces. This code of conduct must be followed
by every Developer contributing to Neeva products, including the Open Source
Neeva Browser project, regardless of affiliation or position.

Community discussions should be
 * respectful and constructive
 * about the Neeva products
 * about features and code, not the individuals involved.

## Do’s

 * Treat other members of the community with respect and kindness.
 * Keep an open-mind around ideas, opinions, and experiences shared in the
   community. 
 * Show empathy towards other members and assume positive intent in all
   interactions. 
 * Build on each other's ideas. Disagree respectfully and constructively. 
 * Provide constructive and thoughtful feedback.
 * Be respectful of other members, and their privacy.

## Don’t’s (These will not be tolerated)

 * Harassing comments
 * Intimidation
 * Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, channels, lists, etc.
 * Offensive or violent comments, jokes or otherwise
 * Inappropriate sexual content
 * Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention
 * Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
 * Distribution or threat of distribution of personally identifying information,
   AKA “doxing”

## Speak up if you see or hear something.

You are empowered to politely engage when you feel that you or others are
disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what
they are doing - politely bringing their behavior to their attention is
encouraged.

If you are uncomfortable speaking up, or feel that your concerns are not being
duly considered, you can email Neeva community managers at <community@neeva.co>.
All concerns shared with community managers will be kept confidential unless
those individuals instruct us otherwise.

## Consequences for failing to comply with this policy

These rules are not negotiable. Community participants asked to stop any
harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Violations will result in
a ban from the community. If you have any questions, please email
<community@neeva.co>.
