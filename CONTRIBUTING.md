# Contributor guidelines

We'd love for you to contribute to this repository. Before you start, we'd like
you to take a look and follow these guidelines:

  - [Good First Issues](#good-first-issues)
  - [Submitting an Issue](#submitting-an-issue)
  - [Creating a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request)
  - [Commits](#commits)
  - [Privileged links](#privileged-links)

## Good first issues

Want to contribute but don't know where to start? Here is a list of
[good first issues](https://github.com/neevaco/neeva-android/labels/good%20first%20issue).

## Submitting an Issue

If you find a bug in the source code or a mistake in the documentation, you can
help us by submitting an issue to our repository. Before you submit your issue,
search open and closed issues, maybe your question was already answered.

## Creating a pull request

- All pull requests must be associated with a specific Issue. If an issue
  doesn't exist please first create it.

- Before you submit your pull request, search the repository for an open or
  closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to
  duplicate effort. 

## Tests

- Automated tests are important. You should write tests! This is how we guard
  the code against regressions.

- New code should include tests that provide coverage for the functionality of
  the code.

- Bug fixes should include tests that prevent the bug from re-occuring in the
  future.

- It is everyone's responsibility to write tests, and as a code reviewer, you
  should expect PRs to include tests.

- Prefer smaller unit tests over larger integration tests.

## Privileged links

At times core contributors and Neeva employees will link to external resources
that are privileged and not publicly accessible. We do our best to prefix these
links with a lock emoji (ðŸ”’).
